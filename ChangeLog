sl (0.3.4) 2006-12-21

  * slight documentation improvement for `sl_filter()`
  * remove debian files; the debian guys like to make their own
  * remove config.h

sl (0.3.3) 2005-10-29

  * added the `sl_filter()` function; tests & original
    implementation by Richard Spindler
  * no more recursive make
  * bumped '-version-info'

sl (0.3.2) 2005-08-20

  * allow linking from C++ (caught by Joop Renes)
  * remove old arch-tag lines
  * minor source reorg. 
  * no need to recompile tests if only library has changed
  * assume STDC headers exists
  * tab -> spaces translation
  * update bootstrap file

sl (0.3.1) 2004-04-09

  * added Debian package generation
  * up version + add hand-written changelog
  * use pod instead of doxygen for docs + minor tree-reorg
